# üöÄ Knox Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Your MVP is Ready!

All code has been committed to git and is ready to push to GitHub.

---

## üì§ Step 1: Push to GitHub

The repo has been initialized and committed. To push to GitHub:

```bash
# You need to authenticate first. Run ONE of these:

# Option A: Using GitHub CLI (recommended)
gh auth login
git push -u origin main

# Option B: Using Personal Access Token
# 1. Create token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# 2. Then push:
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/jasoncoawette/Knox.git
git push -u origin main

# Option C: Using SSH (if you have SSH keys set up)
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jasoncoawette/Knox.git
git push -u origin main
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Step 2: Deploy to Railway

### Option A: Deploy via Railway CLI

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Deploy
railway up

# Set environment variable
railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

### Option B: Deploy via Railway Dashboard

1. Go to https://railway.app/
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your Knox repository
5. Railway will auto-detect the configuration
6. Go to "Variables" tab and add:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` = your OpenAI key
7. Click "Deploy"

Your API will be live at: `https://knox-production.up.railway.app`

---

## üîë API Keys Setup

### For Local Development:

1. Copy the example env file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` and add your keys:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp-your-github-token-here  # Optional
```

### For Railway Production:

Add these in Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Variables:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` (optional)

---

## üß™ Test Your Deployment

### Test Locally First:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run demo
python knox.py demo

# Start server
python knox.py server
```

Visit: http://localhost:8000

### Test Production:

Once deployed to Railway, visit:
- `https://your-app.railway.app/` - Homepage
- `https://your-app.railway.app/health` - Health check
- `https://your-app.railway.app/docs` - API docs
- `https://your-app.railway.app/report/demo` - Demo report

## üéØ For Your Boeing Demo

### What to Show:

1. **GitHub Repository**:
   - Show the clean, professional code structure
   - Point out the comprehensive README
   - Highlight the security detection rules

2. **Live API**:
   - Open the Railway-deployed API
   - Show the beautiful homepage
   - Navigate to `/report/demo` to show the HTML report
   - Open `/docs` to show the Swagger API documentation

3. **CLI Demo**:
   ```bash
   python knox.py demo
   ```
   This shows real-time vulnerability detection in action!

4. **Real Scan**:
   ```bash
   python knox.py scan . --format html --output boeing-demo.html
   open boeing-demo.html
   ```

5. **API Demo** (using curl or Postman):
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/scan/code \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"code": "password = \"admin123\"", "language": "python"}'
   ```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### GitHub Push Issues:

```bash
# If you get 403 error, authenticate:
gh auth login

# Or use token:
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/jasoncoawette/Knox.git
```

### Railway Deployment Issues:

- Make sure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in Railway variables
- Check logs: `railway logs`
- Verify runtime: Python 3.11.7

### Local Run Issues:

```bash
# Make sure dependencies are installed:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Check Python version:
python --version  # Should be 3.8+
```
